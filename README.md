In this project, I work with a dataset of movie reviews with the goal of classifying each review according to its positive or negative sentiment towards the movie. To achieve this, I perform extensive text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization using techniques such as Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec embeddings. I then train and evaluate multiple machine learning models — including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Random Forests, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and an ensemble Voting Classifier — to compare their performance on sentiment classification. The project also includes exploratory data analysis with visualizations like word clouds, frequency plots, and t-SNE for embedding visualization. Finally, the best model is saved and tested on new sample reviews to demonstrate its predictive capability.
